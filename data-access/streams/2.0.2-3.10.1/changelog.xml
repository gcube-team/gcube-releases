	<Changeset component="streams-2.0.0" date="2012-09-01">
		<Change>
			Fault handling in stream publication and consumption aligns
			with fault transport facilities of latest gRS2.
		</Change>
		<Change>Faults are published and abort publication unless they are
			contingencies (cf. StreamContingency annotation).
		</Change>
		<Change>Streams can be conveniently consumed with callbacks (cf.
			Callback interface and Streams#consume()) and callbacks can
			explicitly skip
			elements or stop
			consumption (cf. Iteration class).
		</Change>
		<Change>
			Like callbacks, fault handlers can control iteration directly
			(cf. Iteration). FaultResponse is no longer needed.
		</Change>
		<Change>
			StreamSkipException is replaced internally with
			StreamSkipSignal, and StreamStopSignal is also added to model signals
			from callbacks and fault handlers.
		</Change>
		<Change>
			New stream implementations as well as code that consumes
			streams can now be tested with dedicated facilities.
		</Change>
	</Changeset>
